Direct Addressing here is used to store single key value pairs in a table when number of total keys is small.
Values are stored in the slots. 
Slots are the key itself in Direct Addressing.
Direct Addressing is done using an array implementation.
Slots are the index in the array during implementation.

Operations in direct addressing:
1. Member Time: O(1)
2. Insert Time: O(1)
3. Delete Time: O(1)
4. Print  Time: O(N)

Disadvantage:
Size of table is fixed.
Number of keys must be smalls
